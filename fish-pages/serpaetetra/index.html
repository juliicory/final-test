        <h2> Serpae Tetra </h2>
            <p class="description" left> The Serpae Tetra (Hyphessobrycon eques), also known as the Red Minor Tetra or Jewel Tetra, is a vibrant and striking freshwater fish native to the rivers and streams of South America, particularly in the Amazon basin. 
            <br>The most notable feature of the Serpae Tetra is its deep red body and a prominent black spot, often referred to as a "false eye," located just behind the gill cover. This spot, combined with the intense red color, gives the fish a distinctive and eye-catching appearance. 
            <br>Serpae Tetras are omnivores and will accept a variety of foods. A balanced diet should include high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. This varied diet helps to maintain their vibrant colors and overall health.
            <br>While Serpae Tetras are generally peaceful, they can sometimes display aggressive behavior, especially towards smaller or slower-moving fish. They are best kept with other peaceful, similarly sized fish that can handle a bit of playful chasing. Good tank mates include other tetras, small barbs, danios, and peaceful bottom-dwelling species like corydoras catfish.
