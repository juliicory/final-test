        <h2> Leopold's Angelfish </h2>
            <p class="description">  The Leopold's Angelfish (Pterophyllum leopoldi), also known as the Dwarf Angelfish, is a striking and elegant freshwater fish native to the Amazon River basin in South America. This species is a popular choice for aquarium enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and graceful swimming behavior.
            <br>The Leopold's Angelfish is known for its distinctive triangular body shape and long, flowing fins. The body is generally a light silver or golden color, often adorned with vertical black stripes that can vary in number and intensity. These stripes, which can sometimes appear as spots or bars, give the fish a striking and elegant appearance. The dorsal and anal fins are long and extend far beyond the body, adding to its graceful silhouette.
            <br>Leopold's Angelfish are omnivores and will accept a variety of foods. A balanced diet should include high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. They also benefit from the occasional addition of vegetable matter like blanched spinach or zucchini.
            <br>While Leopold's Angelfish are generally peaceful, they can be sensitive to aggressive tank mates. They are best kept with other peaceful, non-aggressive fish that can handle similar water conditions. Good tank mates include small to medium-sized tetras, rasboras, gouramis, and peaceful bottom-dwelling species like corydoras catfish.
