        <h2> Neon Tetra </h2>
            <p class="description" padding-left="20px"> The Neon Tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) is a small, vibrant freshwater fish that is a popular choice for aquarium enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and peaceful temperament. Native to the clearwater streams of the Amazon basin in South America, this species is known for its distinctive coloring and active schooling behavior.
            <br>The most notable feature of the Neon Tetra is its iridescent blue and red coloration. A bright, iridescent blue stripe runs from the tip of the fish's nose to the adipose fin, which is a small, fleshy fin located between the dorsal and caudal fins. Below the blue stripe, the body transitions to a silver-white color, and the rear half of the fish is marked by a vivid red stripe that extends from the middle of the body to the base of the tail. This coloration is not only aesthetically pleasing but also serves as a form of communication and recognition among schooling fish.
            <br>These fish are relatively easy to care for and are compatible with a wide range of peaceful tank mates. They are omnivores and can be fed a varied diet of high-quality flake food, freeze-dried bloodworms, and small live foods like brine shrimp. Their hardiness and adaptability make them an excellent choice for both novice and experienced aquarists.
